    <h1>It's actually just lemonade</h1>
    <p>Look, I don't want to hear any sass from you top chefs out there.  There really are people out there who don't know how to make lemonade, and this page is for them.  If you've been itching to try your hand at making this classic all-American drink, the time is now.</p>
    <div class="alert"><em>Warning: Do not attempt this recipe if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, inebriated, or using any form of anticitrus medication.  Doing so could result in you completely ruining the vibe.</em></div>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lemons</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a fork to gently scrape away the peel of the lemons.  Do not discard; we will use the lemon peels for another recipe.</li>
        <li>Insert a clean straw into the newly exposed fruit</li>
        <li>Angle the straw into a glass, then use two books to squeeze the lemon without getting your hands wet. The juice should flow through the straw into the cup.</li>
        <li>Empty the contents of the glass into a pre-sugared cocktail shaker</li>
        <li>Add ice and shake vigorously</li>
        <li>Pour the contents of the cocktail shaker into a large bowl and serve</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Making lemonade really isn't as complicated as some beverage officianados would have you believe.  Just be yourself, have fun with the process, and enjoy!</p>
