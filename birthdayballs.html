    <h1>Vegan Birthday Cake Energy Balls</h1>
    <p>I made these birthday cake flavored energy balls for my friend's birthday and we all went insane over them.  They're so good, and easy enough to whip together quickly if you're in a pinch.  Just make sure you have enough time for freezing and thawing</p>
<p> Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>oat flour</li>
        <li>cashew butter</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>almond extract</li>
        <li>ground flax seed</li>
        <li>ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>ground cloves</li>
        <li>oat milk</li>
        <li>vegan white chocolate</li>
        <li>birthday cake sprinkles</li>
    </ul>
    Directions:
    <ol>
        <li>Go to Sprouts because I know there's no way you have all these ingredients at home</li>
        <li>Mix all ingredients except the chocolate and sprinkles in a bowl</li>
        <li>Use your hands to roll the mixture into 1" balls, then place on parchment paper</li>
        <li>Allow the balls to cool in the freezer for 1 hour</li>
        <li>Melt the white chocolate in the microwave, then coat the balls and place on parchment paper </li>
        <li>Add Sprinkles to balls</li>
        <li>Put the coated balls back in the freezer for 2 hours</li>
        <li>Allow to thaw for at least an hour before serving.  Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
